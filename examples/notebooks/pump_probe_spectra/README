As preliminary step for the calculation of pump-probe spectra, the simulation of excited-state dynamics has to be performed (either with PyQME or any external method or software).

For simplicity, here we will use the "excited_state_dynamics/excited_state_dynamics.dat" file generated using "excysted_state_dynamics.ipynb".
